# Content Negotiation Formalisation

This project aims to show the applicability of the formalisation proposed in Chapter 4 and 5 of the thesis: [**]() by providing an implementation along some examples. 

An incremental CN use case is used in the paper and is reflected in the implementation:
1. CN in the classical dimensions: Media type + Language.
2. CN in a basic semantic context: RDF representations + pre-bound profiles.
3. CN in a semantic context with on-the-fly validation: RDF representations + on-the-fly validation.
4. CN in a semantic context taking into account severity definition
RDF representations + severity.
